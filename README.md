## Files in this project

### 1. `Calculator.py`
This file is a **simple calculator** program.  
- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and floor division.  
- Users can input two numbers and an operator to get the result.
- In the while loop section, you can execute a state of the calculator by commenting out one of two states. One section can be executed at a time.

  - Average word length  
  - Most frequently used word  
- You can replace the sample file path with your own text file to analyze custom text.

### 3. `sample.txt`
This is a **sample text file** used for testing the `Text_analyzer.py` program.
